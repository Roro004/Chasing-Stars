# TODO

1. [x] Radial gravity basis for planets and pointy in MainScene
2. [ ] implement chasing behavior (https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src/physics/arcade/accelerate%20to.js)
3. [ ] implement point generaton (add,move,remove)
4. [ ] create pause and play and game over state states (use `this.scene.pause()`)
5. [ ] create a game boundry and boundry condtiions
6. [ ] Stars behavior loops
7. [ ] ~~Make pointy sprite animations for sequences left, right and speed. Do so either by either running a variable through the sequence when the other one is taken through the frame set, actually all have to be variables alternative vector array somehow~~


with Ali

1) Flecks all need a different object in the loop so they start at a different frame in MAIN SCENE

2) How to make pointer erase after update

3) Pointy needs to go to the target locations one after the other
